Summary-

This is the file kept with the intention of planning the development of this web app.
Everything listed below will be the desired features of the app, and the steps required
to complete them.

1. Build a simple online app

    Desc: For back-end, I'll be using Flask/Ajax to create the web app backend

green blocks, 30 seconds, clear the supply zone), Have a check box for accomplished

    Desc: Same approach as feature #3

6. Enter the notes

    Desc: Same approach as feature #3
